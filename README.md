### Introduction

Duc is a small library and a collection of tools for inspecting and visualizing
disk usage. 

Duc maintains a database of accumulated sizes of directories of your file
system, and allows you to query this database with some tools, or create fancy
graphs showing you where your bytes are.

![Example](/img/example.png) 


### Install

Duc depends on the Tokyo Cabinet [1] database library, and on Cairo [2] and
Pango [3] for writing graphs.

2. http://cairographics.org/
3. http://www.pango.org/


On Ubuntu or Debian, the following will install all dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libtokyocabinet-dev
```

On RHEL or CentOS systems, you need to do:

```
$ sudo yum install pango-devel cairo-devel tokyocabinet-devel
```


### Compiling

Duc use the GNU Autoconf system for compiling if you do not have a
pre-built package.  So you can normally just do:


Ubuntu/Debian:  

```
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool
```

RHEL/CentOS:

```
$ sudo yum install autoconf libtool
```

Then you will need to do:

```
$ autoreconf --install
```


```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

to install duc into /usr/local/bin. 



### Usage

Duc comes with a command line tool called `duc`, which is used to create,
maintain and query the disk usage database.  run `duc help` to get a list of
available commands. `duc help <subcommand>` describes the usage of a specific
subcommand.


#### Creating the index

Duc needs an index file of the file system before it is able to show any
information.  To create the index, run the `duc index` command. For example, to
create an index of your home directory run `duc index ~`

```
$ duc index /usr
Skipping lost+found: Permission denied
Indexed 333823 files and 48200 directories, (35.0GB total) in 1 seconds
```

The default location of the database is `$HOME/.duc.db`. To use a different database
location, use the DUC_DATABASE environment variable or specify the database
location with the --database argument.

You can run `duc index` at any time later to rebuild the index.


#### Querying the index

`duc info` shows a list of available directory trees in the database, and the time
and date of the last scan.

```
Available indices:
 2014-05-14 19:06:27   27.7G /var
 2014-05-14 19:06:30   35.0G /usr
 2014-05-14 19:06:49    6.3G /
```

Use the `duc ls` command to see the disk usage of a directory. A specific path
can be specified as command line argument, the current directory is used if omitted.

`dus ls` has some options similar to the normal `ls` program. For example, try
`duc ls -Fcg` for a more friendly output.

```
$ duc ls -Fcg
  4.7G lib/                 [+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++]
  3.1G share/               [++++++++++++++++++++++++++++               ]
  2.7G src/                 [++++++++++++++++++++++++                   ]
814.9M bin/                 [+++++++                                    ]
196.6M include/             [+                                          ]
 66.6M x86_64-w64-mingw32/  [                                           ]
 59.9M local/               [                                           ]
 38.8M i686-w64-mingw32/    [                                           ]
 20.3M sbin/                [                                           ]
 13.6M lib32/               [                                           ]
 13.3M libx32/              [                                           ]
```

For a graphical representation of the disk usage, use the command `duc graph`. This will create
a .png image with the graph of the requested directory.


#### Graphical user interface

For a graphical view, run the `duc gui` tool.

mouse buttons:

left        descent into directory
right       go up one directory
wheel       set graph depth

Key bindings:

```
+           increase maximum graph depth
-           decrease maximum graph depth
0           Set default graph depth
p           toggle palettes
f           toggle graph fuzz
backspace   cd ..
```


#### CGI interfacing

The `duc` binary has support for a rudimentary CGI interface, currently only
tested with apache.  The CGI interface generates a simple HTML page with a list
of indexed directories, and shows a clickable graph for navigating the file
system.

Configuration is done by creating a simple shell script as .cgi in a directory
which is configured for CGI execution by your web server (usually
`/usr/lib/cgi-bin`). The shell script should simply start duc, and pass the
location of the database to offer.

An example duc.cgi script would be

```
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/duc cgi -d /home/jenny/.duc.db
```

* Make sure the database file is readable by the user (usually www-data)
* Debuggin is best done by inspecting the web server's error log
* Make sure the .cgi script has execute permissions (`chmod +x duc.cgi`)

The current CGI configuration is not very flexible, nor secure. Use at your own
risk!


#### TL;DR

```
$ duc help
$ duc help index
$ duc info
$ duc index /usr
$ duc ls /usr/bin
$ duc gui /usr
$ duc graph -o /tmp/usr.png /usr
```


### History

Duc is the replacement for Philesight[1], which I wrote a few years ago but has
some shortcomings (slow indexing, large database) which I felt were not simple
to fix.

Instead of Ruby, Duc is written in plain C, which is probably as fast as it
will get. Duc is about ten times faster then Philesight when indexing, with a
database size which is about eight times smaller.
