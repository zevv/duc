Duc is a collection of tools for indexing, inspecting and visualizing disk
usage. Duc maintains a database of accumulated sizes of directories of the file
system, and allows you to query this database with some tools, or create fancy
graphs showing you where your bytes are.

Check the [Duc homepage](http://duc.zevv.nl) for more information, documentation and news.
